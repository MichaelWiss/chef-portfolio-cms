   - Easy deployment from GitHub
   - $5/month if scaling needed

2. **Render** (Alternative)
   - Free tier: 512MB RAM, limited hours
   - PostgreSQL database available
   - Auto-deploys from Git
   - Good for MVP testing

3. **Heroku** (If available)
   - Free tier discontinued but has affordable paid tiers
   - Excellent ecosystem
   - Easy scaling options

### Frontend Hosting Options
1. **Vercel** (Recommended)
   - Free tier: 100GB bandwidth, unlimited sites
   - Perfect Next.js integration

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Free tier limitations**: Plan migration paths to paid tiers
- **Performance bottlenecks**: Implement caching and optimization early
- **Database size limits**: Monitor usage and optimize queries
- **Vendor lock-in**: Use standard technologies for easy migration

### Business Risks
- **Scope creep**: Stick to defined milestones and features
- **Resource constraints**: Focus on MVP first, iterate based on feedback
- **User adoption**: Gather feedback early and often
- **Competition**: Focus on unique value proposition and user experience

### Contingency Plans
- **Hosting costs**: Have migration plan to self-hosted solution
