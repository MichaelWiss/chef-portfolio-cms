# Update Notes

## Latest Changes Made (August 27, 2025)

### Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration Fixed
- **Issue Identified**: Tailwind CSS v4 was not processing styles properly due to configuration mismatch
- **Root Cause**: Mixed v3-style configuration with v4 installation, causing utility classes to not be generated
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Removed incompatible `tailwind.config.ts` file (v3-style config doesn't work with v4)
  - Converted to proper Tailwind v4 CSS-based configuration using `@import "tailwindcss"` and `@theme` block
  - Defined all custom colors as CSS custom properties in the `@theme` block
  - Implemented all component styles as actual CSS rather than relying on ungenerated utilities
  - Fixed CSS syntax errors (extra closing braces)

### Style System Implementation
- **Custom Color Palette**: Implemented complete color system from STYLE_GUIDE.md
  - Primary colors: cream (#FAF9F6), sage (#A8B5A0), charcoal (#2C2C2C), forest (#3A4A3C)
  - Accent colors: terracotta (#D4A574), pale-rose (#F4E8E6)
  - Complete primary/secondary/accent color scales (50-900)

- **Layout System**: Responsive grid and section layouts

### Technical Configuration
- **PostCSS**: Properly configured with `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin
